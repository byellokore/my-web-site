I did a very small messenger app `Messenger-rails` with Rails and Bulma. 

You can find the source code for Messenger_Rails at GitHub:

[Messenger_Rails](https://github.com/byellokore/messanger_rails)

It's hosted here:

[Messenger_Rails Heroku](https://messenger-rails.herrokuapp.com)

{% highlight ruby %}
def needs_fix()
  #TO DO
  puts "Heroku is asking for Redis to run the ActiveJob"
end
#=> prints 'This post is under development' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
