My name is `Gabriel Fontoura Dos Santos`, nickname byellokore. I'm a software developer currently living in Montreal. This is my first post and I will add more soon.

I spent many years working for the Brazilian Gov and I never had a website or a github account with side projects. It's time!

{% highlight ruby %}
def build_portifolio(name)
  puts "Go #{name}!"
end
build_portifolio('Byel.dev')
#=> prints 'Go Byel.dev!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
